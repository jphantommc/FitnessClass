# FitnessClass

a fullstack web app designed to simplify how people book and manage fitness classes.
From a user’s perspective, the platform allows anyone to browse upcoming fitness classes by type, date, and time. They can easily register, log in, and reserve a spot in any class that fits their schedule. Each user has their own dashboard where they can view, manage, or cancel their upcoming reservations.
On the admin side, we’ve built a full control panel for gym managers to create, edit, and delete classes or trainers. All data is securely handled in a relational database, and the interface is responsive and user-friendly on both desktop and mobile.
The goal of this app is to make gym scheduling more efficient, reduce no-shows, and provide a smooth experience for both fitness enthusiasts and administrators.
Our stretch goals include a dynamic calendar UI, class capacity limits with conflict detection, and even attendance analytics for admins. Thanks for checking it out
